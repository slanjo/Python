#You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".
#
#Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. Heads, not heads.
#
#There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails.
#
#e.g.
#1 means Heads
#0 means Tails
#

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#Hint: Remember to import the random module first. ðŸŽ²


import random


print("Welcome to coin toss program\n")
hd_or_tl = random.randint(0, 1)

if hd_or_tl:
    print("Heads\n")
else:
    print("Tails\n")
