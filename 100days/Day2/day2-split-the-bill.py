#this program will compute the amount of tip required if we'espliting is


#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

'''Below is the format specifier that has format as:
    "{:.2f}" >>> meaning 2 digits after decimal point - similar to C
'''
