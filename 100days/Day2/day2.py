##Data Types
#
##String
#
#print("Hello"[4])
#
#
#print("123" + "345")
#
##Integer
#
#print(123 + 345)
#
##Python interpreter removes "_" from an int. For example an int 123_456_789  can be written with "_"
##for readability, but interpreter will remove "_" and the int will be 123456789
#
#
#
##Float
#
#print(3.145)


#num_char = len(input("What is your name? ")) #integer
#
#new_num_char = str(num_char) 
##print("your name has " + num_char + " characters")
#
#print("your name has " + new_num_char + " characters") #<<<---- this is type conversion (type casting)
#print(type(num_char))
#
#print(type(new_num_char))

# write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. (if the input was 35, you should output 3 + 8 = 8

#a = int(two_dig[0]) + int(two_dig[1]) #convert str to int and add them together
#print(type(two_dig))
